		 	<h2>Some of my experiences</h2>
				<p>If I speak in terms of work, I did a one-week internship in 2017 with a lawyer, I learned a lot from it, including that it wasn't the job I wanted to do. I also babysitted and gave classes to children, helped them with their school work.
				Right now I am an ESSEC student as I said, and I'll do an internship this summer.</p>
